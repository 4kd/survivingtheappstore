# Redefining Success

Success, unfortunately, is a moving target. My own success in the App
Store started off with:

>Awesome, I shipped! Holy crap I got some downloads!

Today it's:

>Damn, my apps only grossed $15k this quarter. After taxes, royalties, and
>partnerships distributions, I only netted $5k. That's near poverty
>level in the US for a two person household. I'm screwed.

Everyone has their form of this internal monologue:

>I can't believe X got so much noterity. My game Y is so much
>better. I put my heart and soul into it and this shoddy rendition
>"makes it"?!

I've been on the receiving end of this kind of frustration, here's
part of an email I've received when someone stumbled upon one of my
Reddit posts:

>I've decided to make an idle game. But a good one. A damn good
>one. Something never seen before. And use the income from this trash -
>to fund games I actually would enjoy making. Such as [New Game X]
>perhaps. I've decided to sculpt in shit, in order to eventually sculpt
>in pure gold. It wasn't easy, mind you.

>So I've almost finished this Idle game. And then...
>...I've bumped your reddit thread. And I am worried. Because this
>time, it might be too much for me to handle. To digest.

>Viral is one thing. But I've always thought of viral as spotlight. And
>spotlight only. So the game has to be good. Otherwise the viral
>effect/spotlight will backfire and actually do more harm than
>good. Well, apparently - I am wrong. Your game is not that bad. Its
>so-so. Decent at best. I've seen worse, I've seen better. But such a
>"decent" game generating so much commotion and income? On a mobile
>platform? In a "paid" model? It did almost all the things from the
>"Forbidden List of Don't". I give up.

**How can I redefine success so that I stop thinking like this?**

## Wealth

I've tried my best in reframing "rich" as a function of time, money,
and quality. So ask yourself the question:

>How long can I maintain my current standard of living without working
>a nine to five?

The premise here is that time and standard of living is a component of
wealth (as opposed to just money). Whose wealthier?

- Someone making $10,000 a month working 50 hours a week, with a cost
  of living at $9,000.

- Someone making $6,000 a month working 20 hours a week, with a cost
  of living at $4,000.

- Someone making $3,000 a month working zero hours a week, with a cost
  of living at $3,000.

Sometimes lowering your cost of living and the amount of
time you work, will increase your wealth. Game development can
be an unending, volatile cycle of feast and famine. For 2016, my projections put
me at netting about $40,000 off of my current mobile games. Which
isn't a lot of money for a two person, two doggies (yes, I said doggies)
household. But if I say:

>My mobile games net me $40,000 if I do _absolutely nothing_, and I
>can live off of $36,000 a year.

Suddenly, I'm wealthier than the person who makes $150,000 a year
living paycheck to paycheck.

Like an idiot, I went whole hog into game development in 2013. I
decided to live off of my savings that I had been stuffing away for
seven years. I got lucky and managed to hit the #1 spot in the App
Store. If I looked strictly at the money, I would have been better off
keeping my day job (even with that kind of success).

But, I think about it... and if I _did_ keep my day job... I'd be at
work in a cubical wearing a buttoned down shirt and slacks. But
instead, I'm sitting on my patio on a Friday, watching my two puppies
roll around in the grass. And I get to take a nap when 3 o'clock rolls
around. So sure, I could be making $140,000 a year right now, but at
what cost to time and quality of life?

## Reframe Money

My poorest performing game makes about $600 a year. That's nothing when
we talk about dollars, but when I say:

>I get free access to high speed internet. And I don't have to do
>anything for it.

Suddenly, it's much more positive and valuable. This type of reframing
is incredibly important for your mental health. The fancy term for
this "find the silver lining" is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I try
my best to do this with every one of my income generating assets:

>Hey, [Game X] pays for my meals.

>Sweet, [This One Thing I Built] covered a couple of car payments.

It's important to note that I actually enjoy the work that I
do. At that point, income is just icing on the cake.

## Screw the Joneses

Stuff for the sake of status is poison. I drive down the streets in my
city and see billboards advertising 4000+ sqft mini mansions for
$400k. Who needs that kind of space? What's the point of buying a
house like that, filling it with stuff, then spending the next 30
years paying it off by working/commuting 50 hours a week?

This infatuation with "Keeping up with the Joneses" takes us away from
doing what we love (building games). What's more important? Sitting
exhausted on the weekends flipping through 200 channels on your 70
inch TV? Or having the time to explore and create _every day_ in your
humble one/two bedroom apartment? Who's more successful?

## Stop Comparing

Please don't be like the person from the email at the beginning. I get
that some are dealt a bad hand in life. But you only make it worse for
yourself by comparing it to other's successes. Take some time and
reflect on what is really important to you. What will make you
happy, how do you want to spend your time (something you can never get
back), and how much money do you really need to pursue it.
