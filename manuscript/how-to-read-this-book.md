# How to Read This Book

## If You're Only Going to Read One Thing in This Book, Read This ##

A successful iOS game makes $4,000 annually (this goes for any app
frankly). A successful Android game makes _one seventh_ of that (one
third at best).

You are not a large multi-million dollar company (at least I don't think
you are given that you're reading this book). So you don't have the
customer acquisition/marketing budget to beat this $4,000 annual
average. Period.

You succeed in the mobile space by building many niche, high quality
games. Trying to gain traction with using a wide net/with the general
populace, is like winning the lottery (Flappy Bird, Crossy Road,
etc). If you make a generic game that's a copy of what's already out
there, it's unlikely you will succeed.

Do not spend more than two months building the first version of your
product. Put it out there soon, get feedback from reviews, iterate on
a steady six week cadence. Market directly to your niche audience
(find the forums, online groups, in person groups that represent your audience).

One game won't make you rich. Hell, three games won't make you rich
(this is coming from someone that had a game at the #1 spot for 18
days straight, and three games in the top #100 apps overall). Build
many games (more than ten) that have a consistent, polished style that
represents _you_ as a game dev. And follow Xzibit's advice:

>Yo dawg. Cross promote your games, in your games, to get people to buy all the
>games you made, that you promoted within your games.

To put it another way. Release one game, and find X people to buy
it. Then make another game. Chances are (if communicated/marketed
correctly), those loyal to you, will buy your other game too. Keep
making good stuff that cater to _this_ group (the one that _also_
bought your _second_ game), and they'll continue buying what you
build.

Also, don't quit your job trying to make it as a game developer unless
you can live with no income for a long time. I repeat, don't blindly
"follow you passion". It won't end well (the last thing I need is
another suicidal email from a game dev that tried to follow in my
footsteps... yes this has happened more than once). I had over $100,000
in liquidity before quitting my job to pursue what I love to do. I got
a college education, saved for _ten_ years, lived well below my means,
and got rid of all my debt. Only then did I feel I was to a point
where I could take some time off and explore what I really wanted to
do with my life. Even then, a whole boat load of luck was involved,
and the constant "shit I need to find a job now" threat is ever
looming till this day (December 2016).

## The Rest of the Advice on How to Read This Book ##

This book is separated into three main parts, plus some fluff. If
you're pressed for time. Read part two immediately, read the
postmortems end the end of each chapter in part one, then read the rest
at your leisure.

The **fluff chapters** were written after emails from game devs and fans over the
last three years. Some of these chapters are to inspire, some are to
help beginners, and some are to give you a reality check.

- Redefining Success
- Get Started with Game Dev When You Don't Know How to Code
- Making Your Apps Accessible to the Blind
- I'd Give Anything

The **first part** of the book are the developer logs of A Dark Room. I
went back through all of them, and reevaluated what I observed then,
with the experience I've gained from doing this for three years. If
you're pressed for time, read the postmortems at the end of each log
and then decide if you want to read the original dev entry.

- Building A Dark Room
- Marketing A Dark Room
- A Dark Room Goes Viral

The **second part** of the book are essays with extremely valuable
pieces of advice/knowledge gained over my time as a mobile game
dev. I've ordered them for you from most important to least important
(again, if you're pressed for time).

- Build Games for Mobile
- Making Small, Sustainable Income
- How to Price Your App
- The Ins And Outs of the Review and Ranking System
- How to Market Your Game on Reddit
- How to Contact Apple About Your Game
- App Store vs Google Play

The **third part** of the book are interviews with other indie game
devs, editors for mobile gaming websites, and other types of content
creators. Each one provides a unique perspective of the mobile
landscape and how to succeed (or fail with style).

For those that don't have time to read the interviews. The general
advice is:

- Build small and quickly.
- Stay true to who you are.
- All of this is hard work.
- Luck plays a huge factor.
- Be genuine when talking to others (don't be a sleazeball, ass wipe marketer).
