# How to Price Your App

Generally speaking, production value (how polished the game looks),
plus niche appeal, dictates the price of your app. The narrower the
niche, the prettier the game, the more you can charge.

Here is a list notable games that you should study. Each game comes
with a little blurb that will tell you what you should observe
closely. You have to _play_ the games to really understand the
execution (I didn't want to spend a lot of time writing long
paragraphs on something that is better explained through just
playing).

Also, I can only vouche for these pricing strategies on iOS. I've
gotten ADR on Android now, but it's still too soon to tell what works
and what doesn't.

## Free to Play + IAP/Ads Done Right

I generally don't like ad supported apps, but the following games do a
great job of it.

**Crossy Road**

Crossy Road does a great job of framing ads as a reward (as opposed
to a punishment when you lose). New characters/skins can be unlocked by
watching video ads. I also like that the new characters don't give you
any kind of advantage in the game (they are purely novelty items).

**Quest Keeper**

I played this longer than I'd like to admit :-P. It has solid gameplay
mechanics which fit well on a mobile medium. The polish is high, the
gameplay is accessible to a large audience. The in-game items can all
be obtained by in-game currency gained through playing. You can get a
reasonable bump of coins by watching a video ad. This is fairly
standard for most ad supported games, but I feel that Quest Keeper
does an exceptional job of it.

**Geometry Dash**

Geometry Dash offers both a free and paid version. **I generally prefer
this approach**. The free version of Geometry Dash has ads, the paid
version does not. The ad frequency in the free version isn't too
intrusive (even though it's shown after you die... which can be
percieved as a pushinment).

Aside:

For A Noble Circle, I took more of a "try before you buy" approach. You can
play A Noble Circle - Prologue for free, and a link is presented at
the end of the game to download the full version.

Aside II:

When A Dark Room went viral, there was no free offering, so cloners
took advantage of that. By offering both a free and paid version, you
keep cloners from name squatting on your IP in case you suddenly go
viral (A Dark Room now is a registered trademark... but that took a
year to get into place, so don't rely on that as a means to stop
clones from cropping up if your game gets popular).

**Threes! Free**

I love this game. Well designed, lovable, extremely high production
value. For a long time, Threes! was only a premium title (being sold
for $2.99). A couple years later, there was a free offering of Threes!
called Threes! Free. In the free version, you're given tokens used to
play the game. Once you run out of tokens, you can watch a video ad to
get more tokens. This approach harkens back to the old arcade
machines. The emphasis here is (again) on not treating ads as a
punishment, but as a means to continue playing the game. I also like
that the user can _decide_ when to watch the ad/refill coins (as
opposed to them interrupting a play session).

**Bardbarian**

Bardbarian is a novel tower defense game (again with good
polish). They took the approach of "pay to remove ads". I usually
don't recommend doing this (just create a premium offering to
compliment the free one). But, if you're going to take the "free, but
pay to remove ads", provide something _additional_ to removing ads. In
Bardbarian, you get a golden axe that gives you a bonus in coin collection
rates. So, while ads are a "punishment" in the game, you can pay to
remove them _plus_ get a cool
new item. Punch Quest (another game I enjoy playing) does a good job
of this too.

## Premium App Pricing Highlevel

The big bucks is in free games with IAP. However, I prefer many niche premium
apps that each generate a small amount of income, as opposed to
betting on just one IP (so keep that bias in mind when reading the
following sections).

If you're going with a premium title, consider the following (in order
of most to least important):

- Make sure it has niche/focused appeal (_not_ for you if your game is
  called Crossy Flappy Candy Clash Saga Royale).
- Make sure it's a game that can be completed (I generally don't
  recommend endless games as premium). You want the player walking
  away saying "Hey, that was worth the price of admission, I am
  happy."
- Zero IAP/ads/data requirements/elevated privileges (promote this in your App's description page).
- If you're going to do IAP, make them DLC's (extra/bonus chapters to
  the game).
- Consider that building premium games keeps you from having to
  compete with AAA companies in the free section (premium is a smaller piece
  of the App Store "pie", but it's also less competitive).
- Make sure it's polished, really polished.

## $0.99

I feel that the $0.99 premium apps are dying off. $0.99 apps, with no
IAP aren't sustainable. There are a few games (aside from mine), that
do well at the $0.99 mark:

- Desert Golfing
- Tiny Wings
- Papa's Freezeria To Go!
- Backflip Madness
- Sumotori Dreams

Try the games above out. I personally find it hard to pin down a
pattern/common thread for these $0.99 games.

With regards to my own $0.99 games, they have very little production
value (nice graphics, music, etc). So, I compensate by providing strong
game mechanics, narrative, and bargain bin prices. The lack of
production value keeps my games from being offered for anything more
than $0.99. I don't want to go free, because I don't like ad/IAP
supported games (and probably because I'm an idiot and an old fart set
in my ways). Hopefully, as fewer and fewer premium apps go for the
$0.99 price, I'll be able to raise my prices too.

## $0.99 + IAP

I feel that $0.99 + IAP premium apps are also dying off. **Plague Inc.**
has this model (and does a tasteful job of it), but the game has been
around for a very long time (**ie, an old app**). There's also **Heads Up!** that takes this
model of $0.99 + IAP (but has also been around for a very long
time, **ie, an old app**). **Peggle Classic** is another $0.99 + IAP app (they took the DLC
approach for Peggle Nights), this as also been aroudn for a very long
time (**ie, an old app**).

Just go with a free app with IAP _and_ a paid app at a higher price
point. You'll get visibility in both App Store sections, which will lead to
more people downloading your game (and hopefully more money).

## 1.99

This is the new $0.99 app. If you're going to do a premium app, at
least start at this price point (and don't budge like I did). You
_can_ of course do IAP's also, but I'd still recommend just doing a
free (with IAP) and a paid offering (w/o IAP).

## 2.99

I don't have any hard evidence (outside of anecdotal conversations with other
indie devs), but most high quality premium apps are moving to this price point. In
short, if a person is willing to pay for $1.99, they are _about_ as
willing to pay for a $2.99 app (**ie, price elasticity is about the same
between $1.99 and $2.99 apps**). Here are some great indie games at this
price point:

- You Must Build a Boat
- Hoplite
- The Five Nights at Freddy's series

Actually there are a lot of them. They are all serious games, with
high production quality. This is what you generally want to shoot for
if you want to go for a premium title.

Additionally, having a $2.99 price point lets you have some wiggle
room for sales (without having to make the game free). So have a great
App Store preview video, great screenshots, and conquer the world.

Aside:

I've been studying the App Store game market for three years
now. There are simply people who buy games, and people that don't (it
takes an immense amount of effort to get free users to "convert
over"). The people browsing the premium market are _already_ willing
to pay upfront for an app. So don't sell yourself short if your
quality is as good as other apps in that price range.

## 3.99+

This is really _above_ the peak price for indie games
(unfortunately). So frankly, do $2.99 worth of work and then
go make your _next_ game. Going above the $2.99 is just a bad
idea (unless you have an amazing team of 5+ people and an _extremely_
well known brand).

Here are a few (large) indie shops in this category:

- Surgeon Simulator
- Monument Valley
- Transistor
- Badlands
- The Banner Saga
- Wayward Souls
- Monument Valley
- Prune
- Alto's Adventure

## Free to Start

I'm really liking the brand/naming of "Free to Start". It gives you full
disclosure at the beginning, so there is no surprise of a pay wall
later on.

**Kung Fury**

If you haven't watched Kung Fury on YouTube, go do that now (better if
you are under the influence). After you've watched the movie, go
download the free game. After you've beaten chapter one, see how quickly
you'll buy the rest of the chapters.

**OPUS**

This a great game that tugs at your heart strings when trying to get
you to unlock the full game (something I do in A Noble Circle
too). Try it out and see if it's something that feels genuine to you.

**Hoplite (on Android)**

This game is the "winner" with regards to doing Free to Start
correctly. On iOS, Hoplite is a premium game with no Free + IAP
offering. On Android, it's free with a very very well placed pay
wall. By the time you hit the pay wall, you already know you'll enjoy
the game and have no problem forking over the money to
continue. Hoplite should provid a free offering on iOS too (as a
companion to the paid version).

# Other Tips on Pricing Apps

Aside from the specific games above, here are some general
tips/observations for pricing your apps.

- Do not put your app on sale during holidays. Those are your highest
  revenue days/people are most willing to spend. You are
  (probably) too small to get any visibility during that time anyways
  (since all the AAA companies will be putting their stuff on sale, or
  release new blockbuster titles).
- Flash sales are good. Don't do it often; don't do it if you plan to
  release an update to your game within a quarter; avoid doing it if
  your rank is steady/rising; market the hell out of your flash
  sale. You're basically sacrificing revenue for rank/visibility and
  reviews.
- If you're going to play around with price/study your price
  elasticity, change your price only once per quarter and stick with
  it. You're not going to get a good picture of your price elasticity
  if you go with a time frame less than 90 days.
- Special event discounts are nice to do (one year anniversary,
  promotion for new IP, etc). Really only do this if you already have
  a good following/fan base.
- Make the IAP's in your game compelling and quantifiable. Removing ads isn't
  compelling, double generation of coins isn't quantifiable, "bag of
  coins" isn't quantifiable. Stick to obvious consumables items, DLC,
  permanent upgrades, or visual/novelty items.

That's my brain dump on pricing. Good luck!
