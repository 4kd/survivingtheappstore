# Interview With Ed Biden - Head of State

A Dark Room iOS's twitter, an _active, genuine_ indie dev,

[this Gamasutra article](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/EdBiden/20160912/281109/How_Head_of_State_went_from_Passion_Project_to_Top10_Download.php) led
to this interview. Head of State is simply a great _evil_ time. The
tutorial is welcoming, the art is great unique, the music is great
too, and I got a strong sense of cognitive dissonance when playing (any
game that evokes emotion is a great game in my book).

>How old are you? What's your professional and educational background?

I'm 34. I grew up in the UK, studied Human Sciences at Oxford then
worked in a range of industries from venture capital to running a soft
drinks brand before ending up in the games industry. I spent a year in
Paris making Facebook games and then 3 years in Berlin making mobile
games (both as a product lead rather than a developer) before leaving
to work in e-commerce, learning to code and making Head of State.

>What technologies/frameworks did you use to build Head of State?

Unity, coding the scripts in C# and bug fixing where necessary and as
little as possible in XCode (... I hate it SO much).

>Head of State had me dealing with a lot of cognitive dissonance
>(nothing ever felt black and white with my choices). How have players
>responded to this?

Some players have found the choices you make to be ambiguous or to
have too little feedback. This was partly a conscious design choice -
when we added more feedback the game seemed far to complicated, so we
toned it back a bit.

Others agonised over every decision, as they were forced to choose
policies they would never endorse in real life in order to win. This
was definitely by design, because we wanted people to think about the
process of entering a democratic election as a candidate, and what you
might be prepared to sacrifice and compromise on to win.

>How long did it take to build Head of State?

About 8 months, coding 10-15 hours a week, having done very little
coding before (so a LOT of refactoring, debugging and getting
stuck). Head of State is perhaps 80% of the coding I've ever done. I
had help from a writer and an artist too which helped immensely, not
only by providing assets and content, but having collaborators to
bounce ideas off and hold me accountable to self imposed deadlines.

>How big is the code base?

About 20k lines of code.

>How much lifetime revenue (gross) has the game generated on iOS? On Android?

The game has been live on both platforms for 18 days now.

On iOS we got featured on the homepage in 83 countries (#15 or #16 in
New Games we Love), so far we've made $27k revenue, $17k proceeds,
14.9k downloads. At the moment we're getting about 100 downloads a
day.

On Android you couldn't even find our game in the Play Store the day
it launched. So far we've made just under 500 EUR (revenue), 320 EUR
proceeds. We get 3-5 downloads a day there at the moment.

>During the sale and development of Head of State, what was one of
>your happiest moments?

Seeing Head of State climb to #5 paid game in the UK - you could see
it above the fold in the charts. I was ecstatic, and it didn't feel
quite real. I kept checking the charts every hour or two to see if we
moved and whether we would keep climbing. I knew from making games
professionally how difficult that was. To do it on a first game was
incredibly lucky.

>Your saddest moments?

Not being able to find the game on Google Play as we were featured in
the App Store was incredibly frustrating. The game was there, people
could download it if they had the link, but if you searched for the
name it didn't show up in the first page of results... given the effort
I'd put in to making the Android version work, making the game
playable on variable screen sizes and coordinating a simultaneous
launch on both iOS and Android it was a real kick in the teeth.

My frustrations with iOS were equal at other points in the process. I
lost two days at one point updating first my iOS, the Mac OS, then
XCode and finally Unity to make sure everything was up to date and
played nicely with each other. Unbelievably painful.

>What tips do you have for those that are just starting with
>programming and game development?

Get something on your phone within a day (there are tutorials that
will take you from literally zero coding ability to something on your
phone in four hours, including downloading all the software you need,
which is free). Then build and experiment from there. There's nothing
quite like people asking what you are up to, and whipping out your
phone and showing them a game they can actually play. The reactions
you get, especially if they don't think you can code, give you the
motivation to keep plugging away. You want to have something new to
show them next time you see them.

>We may have a couple of project managers reading this interview. Any
>tips for them with regards to managing a project/interacting with
>developers?

Developers are craftsmen, artisans who work in code. Make them feel
that way. Get them to take pride in their work and create something
that is elegant, functional and delightful for their users. Make sure
they understand the problem you are trying to solve and suggest
answers. They will probably be able to come up with better solutions
than you can.

>Also, we may have a couple of ad men reading this interview. Any tips
>for them with regards to marketing a game?

All the PR I did myself and it went ok (an interview and pre-launch
press on the major mobile blogs; a few non English reviews after
launch). It's just a case of being disciplined:

- Read the advice on writing a press release
- Get it out 2-3 weeks before launch
- Write every email with a personal intro
- Write hundreds of emails
- Follow up once or twice per journalist

But the best and most fun marketing thing I did was write the blog
for Gamasutra about how the game went from a passion project to a top
5 downloaded game. We think this is the reason that the game went from
#200 to #36 in the US charts the week after the launch. People love a
story. I wouldn't start working on a new game without working out the
story I'd write for the launch press now.

>You went for a premium game as opposed to a game that was free with
>IAP. Why?

Well, originally we were going to release the game for free, more or
less as a political statement. The further we got into development,
the higher the quality got. Eventually I realised that we would be
very justified charging for it given both the quality of the game, and
the time we were putting into it.

So we never really thought about the commercial strategy from the
start, just decided to flip from free to premium.

But IAP typically requires a LOT of content. Players chew through
content incredibly fast - I knew this from my time working in F2P
professionally. I wanted something manageable, but also finite. I
wanted to code the game and then be able to leave it and move onto
other games / projects rather than have it hanging over me
indefinitely. I guess I could have done a free mode with IAP to unlock
more game modes etc. but that felt too complicated.

>Given hindsight is 20/20, would you have done anything differently
>with regards to building and selling Head of State?

Not much to be honest. It went a lot better than I ever dared
imagine. I would have started coding earlier though, and just got on
with it. I would have loved to start in June 2015 and launched in
March 2016. With the Brexit referendum and US presidential elections
2016 is the year to be launching political games...

>Any other tips? EG: Any "must do this or don't come crying to me"
>kind of stuff?

- Start the project, don't just talk about it.
- Work out what you are doing that is actually different from everyone
  else. (i.e. what is the launch PR?).
- Finish the project. Ship something.
